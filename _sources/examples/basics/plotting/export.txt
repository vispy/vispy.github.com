Demonstrates rendering a canvas to an image at higher resolution than the
original display.

    # than the original canvas
    scale = 4
    image = canvas.render(size=(canvas.size[0]*scale, canvas.size[1]*scale))
    
    # Display the data in the array, sub-sampled down to the original canvas
    # resolution
    image = image[::scale, ::scale]
    canvas2 = vp.image(image)
    
    # By default, the view adds some padding when setting its range.
    # We'll remove that padding so the image looks exactly like the original
    # canvas:
    canvas2.view.camera.auto_zoom(canvas2.image, padding=0)
